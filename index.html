  <h1>Privacy Policy of binary.gex</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 07/07/2023</p>

  <h2>1. General</h2>
  <p>
    At binary.gex, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle personal data in connection with our mobile application.
    <br /><br />
    We want to be fully transparent: we do not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) from users within the app itself. However, limited information may be collected by third-party services integrated into the app, as described below.
    <br /><br />
    By using the app, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The binary.gex app does not:
    <ul>
      <li>Require account registration or login</li>
      <li>Access or store your name, email address, phone number, or any personal identifiers</li>
      <li>Collect or track your precise location</li>
      <li>Access your camera, microphone, contacts, or calendar</li>
      <li>Send user data to any server operated by binary.gex</li>
    </ul>
    All app functionality works without requiring personal data from the user.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

  <h3>3.1. Google AdMob (Advertising)</h3>
  <p>
    We use Google AdMob to display banner and interstitial ads within the app. Google AdMob may collect limited device information for the purpose of serving relevant ads, including:
    <ul>
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>Advertising ID (e.g. IDFA on iOS)</li>
      <li>Device type, OS version, and app version</li>
      <li>Interaction with ads (e.g., clicks or impressions)</li>
    </ul>
    You can learn more about how Google uses this information in their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy & Terms page</a>.
    You can also reset or opt out of ad personalization in your device settings.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2. Web Content and WebView</h3>
  <p>
    The app may open external web pages using WebView or browser components. These websites are operated by third parties and may collect personal data, cookies, or analytics information according to their own privacy policies. We do not control or access such data.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We do not collect or store user data on our servers. Third-party services used in the app have their own security protocols to protect any data they may access.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    As a user, you have the right to:
    <ul>
      <li>Opt out of personalized advertising via your device settings</li>
      <li>Learn what data Google AdMob may collect and how it's used</li>
